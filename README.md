#TODO

1. Uses web services to retrieve or store data for the app.
Your app must retrieve data from the web service that you build. It could be a list
page that’s using the web service just as we retrieved the course list using an
Android AsyncTask in the labs. If your app doesn’t need to retrieve any data, you
must store data using a web service that you build. Start on the web service
portion early so that you can get the php help timely.

2. Provides Registration and Sign-In with custom account or using a social media
account.
Your app must allow the user to register and login if you implement custom
login. This should be fully functional with validation and proper navigation.
If implementing social media account login, make sure to provide a test
account. If using Facebook login, login under Facebook Developers, go to
application, Roles, on top navigation for tabs, click Test Users and add.
I suggest installing the release apk file on a different tester’s device to test. They
should use the account information provided to login. This will ensure that we can
test your app and run it successfully.

3. You must implement at least one (or more) other high priority user story
(stories) that is (are) important for your project other than the ones listed above.
The more you do in this phase, the less that you have to do for the final phase.

Your source code must have javadoc for all the methods (other than
setters/getters) and comments for any obscure code. Use good naming conventions
for packages and components within your project. Java coding conventions must be
followed that you learned in the past courses. Remove all TODOs. Make sure that
each java file has a header with the information for each class at the top.
