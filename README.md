1. Uses web services to retrieve or store data for the app.
Your app must retrieve data from the web service that you build. It could be a list
page that’s using the web service just as we retrieved the course list using an
Android AsyncTask in the labs. If your app doesn’t need to retrieve any data, you
must store data using a web service that you build. Start on the web service
portion early so that you can get the php help timely.


these	changes	in	your	README.txt	file.				
2. You	must	implement	high	and	medium	priority	user	stories	that	you	provided	in	your	proposal.	Document	this	in	the
README.txt	file.			
3. Your	app	must	save	data	to	the	device’s	storage	using	SQLite	and	one	other	storage	mechanism	(SharedPreferences).	Explain	in
your	README.txt	file	as	to	where	you	implemented	device	storage.			

5. You must write at least one JUnit class for a model classand at least one intstrumentation test to test a fragment/activity in your 
project. The tests need to be throrugh not trivial.

#Implemented

1. Provides Registration and Sign-In with custom account or using a social media
account.
Your app must allow the user to register and login if you implement custom
login. This should be fully functional with validation and proper navigation.
If implementing social media account login, make sure to provide a test
account. If using Facebook login, login under Facebook Developers, go to
application, Roles, on top navigation for tabs, click Test Users and add.
I suggest installing the release apk file on a different tester’s device to test. They
should use the account information provided to login. This will ensure that we can
test your app and run it successfully.

2. Your source code must have javadoc for all the methods (other than
setters/getters) and comments for any obscure code. Use good naming conventions
for packages and components within your project. Java coding conventions must be
followed that you learned in the past courses. Remove all TODOs. Make sure that
each java file has a header with the information for each class at the top.

3. Your app uses graphics to display images - an icon for the app and a logo count as graphics

1. Fix	any	bugs	from	the	previous	phase	that	the	instructor	or	peer	reviewers	found. Address	how	you	incorporated	(or	didn’t)

4. Your	app	must	use	Content	Sharing	to	send	or	receive	information	pertinent	to	the	app.	Content	Sharing	is	sharing	information
from	mobile	devices	via	email,	text	messaging,	or	social	media.	Examples:	Send	a	recipe	using	email,	share	top	score	on
social	media,	etc.	Explain	in	your	README.txt	file	as	to	where	we	can	find	this.
